# Word Search Solver

A simple program to solve plaintext word searches. Written in Python2 by [Fred Adams](https://xtrp.io/). Licensed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

## Overview

The program takes a 2D array of lowercase letters (the word search) and a list of words, and returns the same word search with the words in uppercase.

This repository also includes a Python command line implementation of the program, which can be used to solve word searches easily, without code.

## Download & Usage

1. **Make sure you have Python installed.** Install Python at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Most computers running macOS should have Python pre-installed. Check if you have Python installed by typing the command ```python``` and pressing enter in your command prompt or terminal. If a prompt like ```>>>``` shows up, then Python is installed.

2. type the following command into your computer's terminal and hit enter:

    ``` bash
    curl https://xtrp.github.io/word_search_solver/word_search_solver.py -o word_search_solver.py
    ```

3. Then, to use this function in other Python programs, simply include this line at the top of your programs:

    ``` bash
    execfile("path/to/word_search_solver.py")
    ```

    Note that ```path/to/``` in this command should be replaced with the relative path to the ```word_search_solver.py``` file from your Python program.
